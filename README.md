This project is for classification of emotions using EEG signals recorded in the DEAP dataset to achieve high accuracy score using 
1 D Convolutional nueral network

• convolutional neural network is a class of deep neural networks,used for the classification of both images as well as for time series classification

• In the current work, music video clips are used as the visual stimuli to elicit different emotions. To this end, a relatively large set of music video clips was gathered.

• 32 participants took part in the experiment and their EEG and peripheral physiological signals were recorded as they watched the 40 selected music videos.

• Participants rated each video in terms of arousal, valence, like/dislike, dominance and familiarity. For 22 participants, frontal face video was also recorded.

• The database contains all recorded signal data, frontal face video for a subset of the participants and subjective ratings from the participants.
